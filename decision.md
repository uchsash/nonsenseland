# Nonsenseland Website: Decisions

Last updated: 2026-11-06

This file records what has been decided, what is still open, and what is needed from the owner.

## Status (2026-11-06)

**Phase 1 is built and running locally** (code in `site/`, how to run it in `site/README.md`).
Everything below works and was tested in the browser:
- homepage sections (from the admin), video slider with filters, article slider, free books, published books, ads, newsletter
- video pages (the Facebook/YouTube player loads only after pressing play)
- the reader for articles and books: white/sepia/dark, 2 fonts, size, line spacing, width, progress bar, chapter list, ← → keys, remembers the place, “যেখানে থেমেছিলেন” button
- EPUB and Word import to chapters, with warnings for missing Heading 1 and Bijoy text
- EPUB download; Send to Kindle (switches on once email is set up)
- paid/members chapter locking (tested: sample chapters open, the rest locked, no text leaks)
- search (Bangla), topics, About page with contact form, sitemap, robots, draft preview
- phone layout, dark mode, admin panel

**Left for launch (phase 1):**
1. Real content: replace the **নমুনা** (sample) videos, articles and placeholder covers; upload the two EPUBs.
2. Owner reviews all Bangla interface text (`site/src/i18n/bn.ts`) and the About page.
3. Deployment to Cloudflare. Needs from the owner: domain, Cloudflare account, Neon (database) account, Resend (email) account. Then: R2 storage, Turnstile keys, email DNS records (SPF/DKIM), a cron trigger for scheduled publishing, backups, uptime alert.
4. Privacy Policy and Terms pages (draft to be written, owner approves).

**Known minor issue:** the template's ESLint setup fails to load (a Next 16 / ESLint 9 template bug); type checks and the production build pass.

## 1. Decided

### Design principle: minimal look, strong features
The owner always prefers a **minimal** site. Every design decision follows this:
- Lots of white space, one accent colour (the logo orange), at most 2 fonts.
- No decoration for its own sake: no gradients, heavy shadows, badges, or busy cards.
- Show less per screen: short card text, clear headings, few buttons.
- Features stay powerful but **quiet**. Reader settings sit behind one "Aa" button, filters are simple text chips, and admin-only controls never appear on the public site.
- Sections and ads can be switched off, so the homepage can be made even simpler at any time.

### Product
- **Language:** the whole site is in Bangla (menus, buttons, dates, numbers).
- **Audience:** mostly mobile readers in Bangladesh, so the site must be light and fast.
- **Sections:** intro, video slider (with category filter), feature/article slider, free book library + reader, published books (buy links), ad/promo slots.
- **Videos:** on Facebook for now (must be set to Public). Switch to YouTube later by changing links only.
- **Book files:** the owner provides Word + EPUB for each book. Word goes into the on-site reader as chapters, and EPUB is used for download and Kindle.
- **Send to Kindle:** the site emails the EPUB directly to the reader's `@kindle.com` address. Free books only.
- **Login (phase 2):** email + password and Google.
- **Paid books (phase 3):** read on site only, with a few free sample chapters. Never downloadable.
- **Admin controls everything:** logo, icon, favicon, intro, banners, ads, menu, homepage section order, offers, pages.
- **Every article and video needs a thumbnail** (required field). YouTube thumbnails can be fetched automatically; Facebook ones are uploaded.

### Printed books: buy links + direct selling
- Each printed book has **any number of buy links** (Rokomari, Wafilife, the publisher's page, etc.), each with store name, URL and an optional price, in an order the admin sets.
- **Direct selling from the site is planned (phase 3)**, using the same cart and orders as ebooks:
  - own price and sale price, stock count, on/off per book
  - **cash on delivery first**, with online payment (SSLCommerz/bKash) added alongside
  - delivery charge inside Dhaka / outside Dhaka, set in admin
  - order status: received, confirmed, shipped, delivered, cancelled, with an SMS/email at each step
  - courier booking through Pathao / Steadfast / RedX later, manual at first
  - signed copies (optional extra)
- The owner must buy stock from the publishers to resell. That is a business arrangement, not a technical one.

### Categories
**Videos:** ননসেন্স-আলাপ · বইপ্যাঁচাল · একগুচ্ছ বই

**Articles:** ফিচার · গল্প · বইপ্যাঁচাল · পাঁচমিশালি

**Topics (বিষয়):** instead of sub-categories, every article and video can get one or more **topics** (e.g. বিজ্ঞান, অর্থনীতি, ইতিহাস, মহাকাশ).
- A topic works across all categories, so a ফিচার and a বইপ্যাঁচাল on physics both appear under বিজ্ঞান.
- Each topic gets its own page (e.g. `/topic/science`) and can be used as a filter.
- Topics are created freely in admin, so nothing needs deciding now.
- The category model also supports an optional parent category, so real sub-categories can be added later without changing the core.

### Bangla text
- All Bangla copy written for the site (intro, About, buttons, empty states, error messages) is a **draft for the owner to correct**.
- Every piece of visible text is editable: content in admin, and interface text (buttons, labels) in one Bangla text file.
- Gemini's AI Studio wording is not reused.

### Free books for the library (first two)
| Book | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|
| আ ডেড জ্বিন ইন কায়রো | উপন্যাসিকা (translation) | Ready, already free on the Facebook page |
| কাহো | গল্প (translation) | Ready, already free on the Facebook page |

The owner will send the EPUBs when the reader is ready to test.

### Domain
- Not needed to start building. Development and testing run on a free Cloudflare test address (`*.workers.dev`).
- **Needed before launch**, because these depend on it:
  - sending email (Kindle, password reset) from the site's own address
  - Google login setup
  - bKash API callback address
  - Facebook share previews and Google indexing
- Buy it on Cloudflare Registrar when the site is close to launch, or earlier to reserve the name.

### Logo files
- `Nonsenseland_Icon.svg`: icon, all shapes, ready for web.
- `Nonsenseland_Logo_Outlined.svg`: **full logo for the website.** The tagline was converted to outlines using the original Neometric Alt Medium font file, and it matches the PNG exactly. It no longer depends on any font.
- `Nonsenseland_Icon & Logo.svg` / `.ai`: originals, kept unchanged. (Their tagline is live text, so they are not used on the web.)

### Published books to show (print, with buy links)
Only books written or translated by the owner, not the ones he edited.

- **Drafts, preview and scheduled publishing** for articles, videos and books
- **Site dark mode** that follows the phone's setting, with a manual switch

## 2. How books get into the reader

Done entirely in the admin panel; no developer needed.

1. Create the book (title, cover, description, access: free/paid).
2. Upload the **EPUB** (preferred source) or the **Word file**.
3. The site converts it automatically:
   - splits it into chapters (EPUB is already split; Word splits at every **Heading 1**)
   - keeps bold, italics, quotes, footnotes and tables
   - moves images to file storage
4. **Preview screen:** a list of chapters with titles and word counts. The admin can rename, merge, split, reorder or delete chapters, and fix text, before publishing.
5. Publish. The same EPUB is used for download and Kindle.

**Re-uploading** a corrected file replaces the text but keeps chapter links and readers' saved positions where chapter titles match.

**Why EPUB first:** it is already divided into chapters and cleanly formatted. Using it for the reader too means the reader, the download and Kindle always show the same version.

**Rules for files:**
- Bangla must be **Unicode** (e.g. Kalpurush, Nikosh, SolaimanLipi), **not Bijoy/SutonnyMJ**. Bijoy text turns into garbage on the web, so convert it to Unicode first.
- Word files: use **Heading 1** for chapter titles and Heading 2 for sub-sections, not just bold large text.
- Insert images as real images, not as floating shapes or text boxes.

## 3. Ads and promo slots

One system handles both the owner's own book promos and, later, Google ads.

**Ad slots** are fixed places on the site:
- homepage, between sections
- inside articles, after paragraph N
- after an article ends
- the sidebar on wide screens
- book pages
- the reader: off by default and never shown in paid books

**Each slot has a mode the admin can switch:**
- **Off:** nothing shows, and the space collapses.
- **House ad:** the owner's own banner (image + link + start/end date). Several banners can rotate in one slot.
- **Google AdSense:** later, once the site is approved.
- **Custom code:** for other ad networks or sponsors.

**There is also one master switch that turns every ad on the site off.**

- Each slot keeps a fixed size so the page doesn't jump while loading.
- Before turning on AdSense, the site needs:
  - Google approval
  - a Privacy Policy
  - enough original content
  - a cookie-consent banner for visitors from Europe and the UK

## 4. Payments: starting with bKash

### Account: bKash Personal Retail Account (PRA)
Checked on bKash's official page (2026-11-06): https://www.bkash.com/en/page/personal-retail-account

- Made for micro and small retail and f-commerce businesses. **No trade licence needed.**
- **Documents:**
  - NID
  - a mobile number registered to that NID that has **never had a bKash account**
  - proof of SIM ownership
  - nominee's NID, if applicable
- **The NID must not already be used for a bKash business account** (agent or merchant). A personal bKash account on the same NID is fine.
- Self-registration at https://account.bkash.com/ (no customer care visit needed).
- **Can receive payment by QR, the bKash Payment Gateway, or typed account number.**
- **Limits:** receive up to ৳30,000 per transaction, ৳30,000 per day and ৳5,00,000 per month. That is plenty for book sales.
- **Fees:**
  - receiving payments from customers: free (bKash calls this a promotional offer, valid until further notice)
  - sending money to a customer (for refunds): ৳5
  - cash-out: charges apply after the first 3 months
- Statements are available in the bKash Merchant App.

### Website integration (developer side)
- bKash developer portal: https://developer.bka.sh/
- **Products listed there:**
  - **Tokenized Checkout** (with or without a saved agreement): the customer enters their bKash number, OTP and PIN on bKash's secure page
  - Auth & Capture
  - Refund
  - Query/Search Transaction
  - Instant Payment Notification (IPN)
- API credentials (app key, app secret, username, password) and sandbox access are issued by bKash during merchant onboarding.
- **Not yet confirmed:** whether a **PRA** gets its own API credentials for website checkout. The PRA page says it can receive through the Payment Gateway, but not how a PRA gets connected. **Ask bKash (16247 or the merchant support email) before phase 3.**

### How the site handles it (so nothing core changes later)
The checkout uses **interchangeable payment methods**, each switchable on/off in admin:
1. **bKash automatic (API):** used once credentials are issued. The order is marked paid automatically and refunds are possible from admin.
2. **bKash manual:** the customer pays the PRA number (QR or "Payment") and enters the **TrxID**. The admin checks it in the bKash app and approves, and the order then unlocks. This works from day one with no API.
3. **Cash on delivery:** for printed books.
4. **Later:** Nagad, cards via SSLCommerz, etc. are added as more methods without changing orders.

## 5. Running the site safely

- **Code in a private GitHub repository:** full history, and any developer can pick it up later.
- **Two copies of the site:**
  - a **test site** (e.g. `test.yourdomain.com`) where changes are checked first
  - the **live site**
- **Daily automatic database backups**, plus file storage backups.
- **Admin security:** strong password + two-step login for the admin account.
- **Uptime alert:** a free monitor emails the owner if the site goes down.
- **Updates:** software updates every few months (security fixes), done on the test site first.
- **Admin guide:** a short Bangla/English guide on how to add articles, videos, books, ads and offers.

---

## 6. Phases

1. **Launch:**
   - homepage sections, video slider, feature slider, books row, published books
   - ad/promo slots (house ads)
   - the reader
   - EPUB download + Kindle email
   - full admin with Word import
   - SEO, analytics, legal pages
2. **Accounts:**
   - email + password and Google login
   - reading progress across devices, saved Kindle address, bookmarks
   - newsletter
3. **Selling:**
   - paid ebooks and **direct sale of printed books** (one shared cart)
   - cash on delivery + payment gateway, delivery charges, stock, order tracking
   - coupons and offers, orders and receipts
   - Google AdSense if wanted
4. **Later:** YouTube switch, highlights/notes, installable phone app, more admin roles.

The data model for users, orders, offers and ad slots is created in phase 1, so later phases add features without changing the core.

---

## 7. About page

Editable in admin like every other page. Planned content:
- Who is behind Nonsenseland: a short bio of উচ্ছ্বাস তৌসিফ (writer, translator, science writer)
- What Nonsenseland is: "Talk. Anything and Everything.", plus videos, writing and books
- Photo and/or the sketch caricature
- Highlights: published books (linked to the books section), work at বিজ্ঞানচিন্তা
- Links: Facebook, Instagram, email; YouTube later
- Contact form

---

## 8. Open items: needed from the owner

- [ ] **Approve the plan and technology** above.
- [x] **Logo files:** SVGs received.
- [x] **Logo tagline:** converted to outlines (`Nonsenseland_Logo_Outlined.svg`).
- [x] **First free books:** আ ডেড জ্বিন ইন কায়রো and কাহো (EPUBs to be sent when needed).
- [ ] **Book rights (future books):** list further books that can be free online. Only include books the owner holds the rights to, or has written permission for. Published translations get cover + description + sample chapter + buy link.
- [ ] **Domain:** buy before launch (not needed to start building).
- [x] **Categories:** decided (see "Categories").
- [ ] **Topics:** a first list of topics (বিজ্ঞান, অর্থনীতি…). Optional; can be added any time.
- [ ] **Bangla review:** correct the site's Bangla text once the first version is up.
- [ ] **Book files:** EPUB (preferred) or Word for each free book, final versions, in Unicode Bangla.
- [ ] **Direct print sales:** decide whether to stock books (bought from publishers) and which courier to use.
- [ ] **Kindle test:** send one Bangla EPUB to a real Kindle and check that যুক্তাক্ষর display correctly.
- [ ] **bKash PRA (before phase 3):** open the account (NID + a fresh SIM never used for bKash), then ask bKash whether a PRA can get Payment Gateway API credentials for a website.
- [ ] **Existing Facebook writing:** yes, some posts move to the site. Pick which ones (link + category).
- [ ] **About page content:** bio text and photo (outline in section 7).
- [x] **Launch content:** enough videos already on the Facebook page.

---

## 9. Notes and warnings

- **Selling online (phase 3):** a trade licence is not needed to start with a bKash PRA. Still publish clear delivery times and a refund policy, since customers and payment providers expect them.

- Facebook videos must be Public to play on the site.
- Print-book prices are set by Rokomari, so "offers" on print books are badges/banners only. Real discounts apply only to ebooks sold on the site.
- Paid books are never downloadable or sent to Kindle.
- Web addresses use English words (e.g. `/features/antimatter-review`) because Bangla addresses become unreadable when shared.
